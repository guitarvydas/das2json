# Building A DSL
# usage: 
- open a terminal, run `make`
- open draw.io in another window on `sp2py.drawio`
- open a browser and open file `./plwb.html`
- touch (or edit and save) `rebuild.bash`
the browser should display `begin...` in the Errors textarea, then, after a few moments, should display Python code in the Python window 

this code is stored in `generated.py` and can be used to parse some test XMl, say `sp2py.drawio` using:
- `python3 generated.py <sp2ypy.drawio`

At this stage, the result should be an identity transformation - the output should look like the input.
